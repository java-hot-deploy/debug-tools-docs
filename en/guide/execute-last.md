# Quick Call Last {#execute-last}

The `Quick Debug` shortcut calling method of DebugTools confirms the class and method to be called by the mouse position. When we call through a breakpoint, if the method call is already in another method, we need to find the starting point and re-awaken `Quick Debug` if we want to call it again, which is very inconvenient.  

So at this time we can wake up the right button and click the `Execute Last` button, so that no matter where your mouse is currently located, we can quickly re-call the last method.

::: tip
When calling the last method again, **the parameters passed are exactly the same as last time**, including all data such as parameters, xxl-job, header, configuration, etc.
