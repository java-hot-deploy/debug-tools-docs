    title: Hot Deploy
    details: The traditional deployment process is generally to submit code -> pull code -> package -> deploy -> restart the project before the written code can take effect. Hot deployment can skip this tedious process. After the developer modifies the code, there is no need to manually trigger packaging or restart the service. The application can load the new logic in real time and run, greatly shortening the feedback cycle. After we introduced hot deployment in development/testing environments, the overall development efficiency of the team can be greatly improved, especially for high-frequency iteration scenarios in agile development mode.

    title: Hot Reload
    details: Traditionally, when writing code, you need to restart the application to make it effective. However, hot reload can make the written code effective immediately without restarting the application, making the code changes written by developers take effect instantly, greatly improving iteration efficiency. Supports changes to properties and methods of classes (including proxy classes), Spring, Solon, Mybatis and other mainstream frameworks. At the same time, it is compatible with multiple JDK versions such as jdk8, jdk11, jdk17, jdk21, etc.

    title: Call any Java method
    details: Quickly call any Java method (local/remote), such as static methods, instance methods, methods of Beans managed by Spring (Dubbo, XxlJob, MQ, etc.), Mybatis Mapper methods, etc., support multi-dimensional and multi-type parameter passing, passing header parameter information for authentication, passing XxlJob parameters for task execution, etc. There is no need to write test cases or call from API tools layer by layer, which greatly saves developers' debugging time.
